###Context-1

For a small number of files (e.g. 8 or less), a module folder can be written using a flat structure,
as it can be reasoned that it remains easy to find and identify files.

Should the number of files become too many, or if a folder-based structure is preferred regardless, then
the layout used in either Context-2 or Context-3 should be adopted.
